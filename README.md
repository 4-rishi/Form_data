## FORM COMPONENTS 

This codebase consists of React components to be rendered during form filling.
The components added are as follows - 

1. Text Input 
2. Audio Input
3. Checkbox
4. Dropdown
5. Numeric Input
6. Photo Input
7. Video Input

These components can be found inside "my-react-app > src > components" Directory.
These react components are to be used at various parts of the code ( whereever required ). I have also included the basic styling of these components.

In the src folder, the react component "Form.jsx" is calling these components to generate a dynamic and responsive multi-page form. 
The src folder also has a "data.json" file that is being used by the form component to render the form. 

To make changes in the codebase, do NOT push your code directly to the main branch and create a specific branch for changes. 

## HOW TO RUN THE CODE 

1. Clone the "my-react-app" folder into your local dir
2. The code uses vite environment, so make sure to add it. ( npm create vite@latest to crerate your own dir )
3. Check for the node modules before running the code.

   To start the server, run this on command prompt -

      > npm install ( for node modules )
      > npm run dev


Happy Hacking!
