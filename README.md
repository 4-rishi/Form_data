# Project README

This codebase comprises React components designed for form filling. The included components are:

- Text Input
- Audio Input
- Checkbox
- Dropdown
- Numeric Input
- Photo Input
- Video Input

These components are located in the `my-react-app > src > components` directory. They will be utilized throughout the codebase as needed. Basic styling for these components is also provided.

Within the `src` folder, the React component `Form.jsx` is responsible for calling these components to generate a dynamic and responsive multi-page form. Additionally, the `src` folder contains a `data.json` file, which the form component uses to render the form.

## Making Changes

To make changes to the codebase, do **not** push your code directly to the main branch. Instead, create a separate branch for your changes.

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the `my-react-app` folder into your local directory.

2. The code uses a Vite environment. Set it up with the following command:
   ```sh
   npm create vite@latest
   
3. Ensure the necessary node modules are installed before running the code.

4. To start the server, run the following commands in your terminal:

   > npm install
   
   > npm run dev

Happy Hacking!
